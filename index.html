      <p>The Mid Michigan Ren Faire started to expand the summer festivities that Midland Michigan brought to the table. After the huge success of holding Comic Con Midland in the Midland Mall, Ren Faire enthusiast J.P. decided to partner with Dow Gardens to create this late summer festivity.</p>
      <p>Open to all ages, the Mid Michigan Ren Faire is held at Dow Gardens and the Whiting Forest in Midland, MI. Activities begin at 10am every Friday-Sunday during August and September 2024.</p>
